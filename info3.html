                <h1>False Confessions</h1>
                <p>
                    &emsp;False confessions are a significant cause of wrongful convictions, often occurring when individuals are pressured or coerced during police interrogations. People may falsely confess to crimes they did not commit due to intense interrogation techniques, fear, confusion, exhaustion, or the belief that admitting guilt will bring a quicker end to their ordeal. Vulnerable individuals, such as juveniles or those with mental impairments, are particularly at risk. These false confessions can seem convincing to juries, leading to wrongful convictions and severe consequences for the innocent.
                    <br><br>&emsp;The impact of false confessions on wrongful convictions is profound. Once a confession is made, it heavily influences the investigation and trial, often overshadowing other evidence that might prove innocence. This can result in the real perpetrator remaining free while an innocent person is punished. To prevent false confessions, it is crucial to implement better interrogation practices, ensure the presence of legal counsel during questioning, and use recording equipment to document interrogations. These measures can help safeguard the rights of suspects and reduce the risk of wrongful convictions based on false confessions.
