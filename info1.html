                <h1>Witness Misidentification</h1>
                <p>&emsp;One of the most common reasons for wrongful convictions is witness misidentification. There are two main reasons for witness misidentification; faulty memory or suggestive identification procedures. There are probably many other reasons for witness misidentification however they are not as commonly talked about.
                    <br><br>&emsp;The first reason, faulty memory, is because the human brain is not perfect. Our brains are not recording devices, as such our memory will not remember everything exactly. Especially in stressful situations, our brains try their best to keep everything rational and reasonable even if that means altering our memory. However that doesn’t help when we need someone to identify a suspect. In many cases a witness will identify an individual and after a simple DNA test however it typically proves the identification to be wrong. 
                    <br><br>&emsp;The second reason isn’t even the witnesses fault, its suggestive identification procedures. For example waiting for an elongated period of time to ask the witness for they’re description of the suspect so that they’re memory is skewed from the time gap. Another way is giving the witness an assortment of images to pick out the potential suspect, however only one of the images match the description from the witness while the rest aren’t even close. One of the last ways that the witness's identification will be skewed is by the police officer conducting the identification process. The police officer can try to influence the witnesses identification by the comments they make.
