                <h1>Official Misconduct</h1>
                <p>&emsp;Official misconduct is a major reason for wrongful convictions. This happens when officials care more about getting a conviction than finding the truth. They might intimidate witnesses to give false information or create fake evidence just to secure a guilty verdict. In these cases, the officials donâ€™t care if the person is actually innocent. Such actions destroy public trust in the justice system because people see that those who are supposed to protect justice are the ones breaking it.
                    <br><br>&emsp;The effects of official misconduct are severe and long-lasting. Often, these cases are revealed only after many years, usually through long legal battles and the hard work of innocence projects and investigative journalists. Sadly, not all cases come to light because the threats and intimidation from officials can scare witnesses and victims into staying silent. This ongoing fear makes it harder to uncover the truth and correct the wrongs. To rebuild trust in the justice system, we need stronger rules to hold law enforcement and prosecutors accountable, independent oversight groups, and better checks and balances. By tackling official misconduct, we can better protect innocent people and ensure that justice is truly served.
